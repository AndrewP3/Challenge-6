Purpose: 

In this app, the user is able to enter the name of a city or state in the search field, then click the search button and the app will display the current weather for that particular location. 
The information for each city will display the current weather conditions in that city, including temperature, humidity, UV index, and a picture representing whether it is clear, cloudy, raining, etc.
Everytime a user searches for a city, a button displaying the information is created below the search field. When the user clicks on that button, a new search is executed for that location. 
Additionally, if the user closes the window or refreshes the browser, the search history buttons remain, and the app will open up with weather results for the last city the user searched for. 
Finally, clicking the "Clear History" button clears the user's local storage and removes the history buttons from the page.
